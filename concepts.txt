budget animation ideas:

the problem: 

angle of surface needs to influence character animations

some possible solutions: 

* This problem is solved in melee by transforming the foot bones to align with the surface angle.
* I cant use this solution because I cant handle 3d animation. (for now)

* make all entity sprites that can interact with surfaces semishperical. clip models based on angle.

* shear parts of sprite based on angle

* make different sets of animations for different ranges of angles

* make pure wireframe models, these could even be 3d?

* PRERENDERED SPRITES FROM 3D MODELS?!?!?!?!?!?!?




"precalculated" collision hash physics:

essentially create a has table that hashes world coordinates into nearby surfaces that should be tested for collision

* only works with static stage collision(?) would have to update table if a surface moves, or bake the surfaces potential movement into the cell lists

draw grid around stage collision, cells of the grid do not have to be square, 
the cells only have to be large enough to be an axis-aligned bounding box for the smallest surface in the scene
create a table (2d array) that maps the cell indecies to a list (a "bucket" in hash table terms) of the surfaces contained in that cell

at runtime, entities look up nearby surfaces to test for collision by converting their world coordinates into table indicies.

problems: 
complicated as shit
no real way to limit the list sizes?
