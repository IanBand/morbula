main character is a scientest, white lab coat, like scientest npc in pokemon
creatures/experiments have escaped from the lab
lab/enviornment is a mix of futurology/nature. metroid fusion inspired but extremely open world like super metroid
play as scientest, lab assistant(s) or other experiemts
absorbtion mechanic: scientest will absorb data, most experiments will absorb souls. scientests will "quantify" enimies
playable experiements are attempts at creating higher forms of conciousness/intelegence
half of game is in a dream/simulated world. mechanics and overall gameplay is the same, just an excuse for a change of scene
